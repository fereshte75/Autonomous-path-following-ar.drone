# Autonomous-path-following-ar.drone
This project is my master's Thesis in politecnico di milano.   It envolves using the node.js module from felixge program the parrot ar.drone 2.0 to autonomously follow a prepared route in an indoor environment using the oriented roundel tag detectable by the drone.
